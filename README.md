# Udacity-Computer-Vision

These are work and projects I developed as a part of [Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891).

## Relevant Projects

You can also view my [self driving car projects](https://github.com/Michael-Tu/Udacity-Self-Driving-Car) and [robotic projects](https://github.com/Michael-Tu/Udacity-Robotics). 

These projects include but not limited to facial recognition, facial keypoints detection, automatic image captioning, and landmark detection and localization using SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping).


## Environment Setup
Make sure you have Anaconda installed. Then, run `conda env create -f environment.yml` to install all necessary packages needed for all my projects.
